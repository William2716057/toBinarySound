# Text to Binary Tone Converter
This Python script converts an input text message into its binary representation and plays corresponding tones for each bit using pyaudio and numpy. Each bit of the binary representation is mapped to a specific frequency: one frequency for '1' and another for '0'.

## Features
- Converts input text to binary representation.
- Generates sine wave tones for each bit in the binary representation.
- Plays the generated tones through the system's audio output.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pyaudio

## Installation
